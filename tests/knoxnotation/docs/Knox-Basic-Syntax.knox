# Admonitions

---Tip
This is a tip admonition text.
---

One can use a title in an admonition:

---Warning - This is an Admonition Title
Here's the text.

Cite admonitions are also allowed:

---Cite
Cite admonitions work similarly to blockquotes, except that the cite will display the admonition format.

# Paragraphs

This is a paragraph. This will be rendered as `<p>` in HTML.

## Blank lines are paragraphs

All empty lines will become a paragraph. Therefore the line above this, will be rendered as `<p>` too.

## Hard breaks

Hard breaks are done like this:
Immediately subsequent paragraph lines will be interpreted as a hard break, by inserting a `br` inside the same paragraph.

## Line connection

To connect two lines, \
use a backslash in the end of the line. \
This rule applies for any line type (besides the paragraph).

## Line ignoring

If a line contains only a backslash, it will be ignored. For example:
\
\
(The last two previous lines will be ignored).

# HTML insertion
HTML elements may be inserted directly, like this: `<div>HTML element</div>`.

# Tables
Tables are a problem to write in ascii. I have to figure out something that is simple.

# Images
I have to figure out something that is simple.
Maybe <image -- www.url.com>{alt text}

# Metadata

---Meta
Author: John Doe
Description: This is the basic sintax.
---

By default, the meta block will not be displayed.

One recommend to use the metadata block at the end of your document, since it's visually better.
