## Heading 2

This is another pararaph.

# Inline formattings

*Bold text*

_Underlined text_

==Emphasized text==

`Inline code`

# Line merging

To merge two or more lines, \
use a backslash in the end of the line. \
This rule applies for any line type, except code blocks.

Spaces are not automatically added, \
so you have to use a space before the backslash to keep lines separate.

# Lists

## Bullet list | Unordered list

> Block Title (optional)
- Item X
- Item Y
- Item Z

## Enumerated List | Ordered list

> Numeric with a point
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

Ideally, the text editor should enumerate automatically the list for the user.

## Nested lists

Use four spaces identation.

- Item X
    - Unordered subitem
    - Unordered subitem
- Item Y
    (a) Ordered subitem 1
    (b) Ordered subitem 2
- Item Z
    - Subitem
        - Third level item
    - Subitem

# Thematic break | Horizontal rule

* * *

# Links

## Bare Links

Bare links are automatically identified, like: http://www.example.com.
Common trailing punctuation marks will not be considered part of the link, namely:
1. Period
2. Comma
3. Question mark
4. Exclamation mark
5. Colon
6. Semicolon
7. Close brace

## Chevron Links

For avoiding link ambiguity, use chevrons: `<http://www.example.com>`.

## Labeled Links

- Use curly braces before the bare link: `{Example Website}http://www.example.com`.
- Or use curly braces before the chevron link: `{Example Website}<http://www.example.com>`.

# Admonitions

---Tip
This is a tip admonition text.
---

One can use a title in an admonition:

---Warning - This is an Admonition Title
Here's the text.
---

Cite admonitions are also allowed:

---Cite
Cite admonitions work similarly to blockquotes, except that the cite will display the admonition format.
---

# Paragraphs

This is a paragraph. This will be rendered as `<p>` in HTML.

## Blank lines are paragraphs

All empty lines will become a paragraph. Therefore the line above this, will be rendered as `<p>` too.

## Hard breaks

Hard breaks are done like this:
Immediately subsequent paragraph lines will be interpreted as a hard break, by inserting a `br` inside the same paragraph.

## Line ignoring

If a line contains only a backslash, it will be ignored. For example:
\
\
(The last two previous lines will be ignored).

# HTML insertion
HTML elements may be inserted directly, like this: `<div>HTML element</div>`.

# Images
I have to figure out something that is simple.
Maybe `<image - www.url.com>{alt text}`.

# Metadata

---Meta
Author: John Doe
Description: This is the sintax description.
---

By default, the meta block will not be displayed.

One recommend to use the metadata block at the end of your document, since it's visually better.
